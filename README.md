## Model Training
The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of cat and dog images. The training process includes data augmentation, model compilation, and fitting the model on the training data.

## Heatmap Visualization
Heatmaps are generated to visualize the areas of the images that the model focuses on during classification. This helps in understanding the model's decision-making process.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 75% on the test dataset. The heatmaps provide insights into the model's focus areas for both correct and incorrect classifications.
